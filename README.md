## Uploading New Content
### Adding New Entries

To add a new lab member or entry:

- Create a new directory: Create a new directory for the member under /assets/content/ with a unique identifier.

```
  /assets/content/<member_id>/
```
- Prepare your model: Ensure your model file is in the correct format (e.g., .glb, .gltf).

- Update param.json: Ensure the param.json file in the same directory has the correct modelFile entry:

param.json example:

```json
{
  "member": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "labID": "002",
    "role": "Graduate Research Assistant",
    "note": "Exploring the intersection of AR and VR",
    "link": "https://johndoe.com",
    "startYear": "2021",
    "audioFile": "audio.mp3"
  },
  "model": {
    "modelFile": "model.glb",
    "position": "0 -2 0.5",
    "scale": "0.4 0.4 0.4",
    "animationIndex": "2",
    "credit" : "CREDIT INFORMATION HERE"
  }
}
```
- (Optional) include an audio.mp3 or audio.ogg in the directory and specify it in the param.json
